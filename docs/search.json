    "text": "Hello! My name is Leena Soo. I am currently a student in Singapore Institute of Technology pursuing a degree in Applied Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\nI completed my O’Levels in 2018 and went on to Singapore Polytechnic to pursue a Diploma in Bioengineering. After finishing my studies, I took a gap year and worked with Biosensors, a company specialised in building catheters as an Research and Design Engineer. I really enjoyed my entire time there where I get to witness the behind the scene of the building something for inert of the body, how precise we have to be. As much as engineering is my forte, I do want to still continue my studies in something that the world is currently moving towards to which is technology. Hence, I made a decision to continue on studies in Degree in Applied Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\n\nOver my student life, I have always worked part time along side my studies.\n\n\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy play games as well as trying new things where recently I have been enjoyed rockclimbing and travelling.\n\n\n\nFeel free to reach out to me via [your contact information or social media links].\n\nThank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me!"
